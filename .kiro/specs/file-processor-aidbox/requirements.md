# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a simple Python application that monitors a directory for new files and automatically sends them to an Aidbox REST API. The application is designed to run as a Google Cloud Function in the future, with a main launcher that executes the file processing function every 10 seconds. The system focuses on simplicity and includes basic logging for monitoring results and errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to automatically monitor a directory for new files, so that I don't have to manually track when files are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL monitor a specified directory for new files
2. WHEN a new file is detected in the directory THEN the system SHALL identify it as ready for processing
3. WHEN the monitoring process encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data integrator, I want new files to be automatically sent to the Aidbox REST API, so that the data can be processed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new file is detected THEN the system SHALL read the file contents
2. WHEN the file contents are read successfully THEN the system SHALL send the data to the Aidbox REST API via POST request
3. WHEN the API request is successful THEN the system SHALL log the successful operation
4. WHEN the API request fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details
5. WHEN a file cannot be read THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip that file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the application to run continuously with scheduled execution, so that file processing happens automatically at regular intervals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main launcher starts THEN the system SHALL execute the file processing function every 10 seconds
2. WHEN the scheduled execution runs THEN the system SHALL call the file processing function once per interval
3. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL continue processing until manually stopped
4. WHEN an execution cycle completes THEN the system SHALL wait for the next scheduled interval

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all operations and errors to be logged to a file, so that I can monitor the system's behavior and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation occurs THEN the system SHALL write a log entry with timestamp and operation details
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error message and relevant context
3. WHEN a successful API call is made THEN the system SHALL log the success status and response details
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create or append to a log file
5. WHEN logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation without crashing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be simple and suitable for Google Cloud Functions deployment, so that it can be easily deployed and maintained in the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is structured THEN the system SHALL use a simple, minimal architecture
2. WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL use only essential Python libraries
3. WHEN the main function is designed THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Google Cloud Functions entry point requirements
4. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL include all necessary configuration and dependencies
