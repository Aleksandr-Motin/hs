# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement retry logic for file read errors

  - Remove incorrect `mark_file_as_processed(file_path, "error")` call on file read failures
  - Implement endless retry loop with delay for file read failures
  - Add retry attempt logging with filename prefix
  - Ensure same file is retried until successful read
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.2, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Implement retry logic for network failures

  - Update logic to check for HTTP 200/201 status codes to determine if message was delivered
  - Add logic to distinguish between delivery success and processing success
  - Implement endless retry loop with delay for network failures
  - Add comprehensive logging for network failure retry attempts
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 3. Enhance exception handling with retry logic

  - Update generic exception handler to retry instead of marking files as processed
  - Add logging to explain retry attempts on unexpected exceptions
  - Implement retry delay for unexpected exceptions
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Standardize log message formatting with filename prefixes

  - Update all file-specific log messages to include [filename] prefix consistently
  - Ensure processing start, file read, and completion messages use consistent format
  - Update error messages to include filename context
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Verify file sorting implementation

  - Confirm alphabetical sorting is working correctly in get_new_files method
  - Test that files are processed in A-Z order consistently
  - Add logging to show file processing order
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 6. Update processed file marking logic

  - Ensure files are only marked as processed when HTTP 200/201 is received
  - Implement proper status assignment based on processing success/failure
  - Remove any incorrect processed file marking from error paths
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive logging for API response handling

  - Include HTTP status codes in all API response log messages
  - Add message IDs to success and error log messages
  - Distinguish between delivery failures and processing failures in logs
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Implement configurable retry delay period

  - Add RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS configuration parameter to config module
  - Update retry loops to use configurable delay instead of hardcoded values
  - Set sensible default value (5 seconds) when not configured
  - Add environment variable support for retry delay configuration
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 9. Create unit tests for improved error handling
  - Test file read error scenarios with retry behavior
  - Test network failure scenarios with retry behavior
  - Test processed file marking logic with various HTTP response scenarios
  - Test log message formatting consistency
  - Test configurable retry delay functionality
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation through testing_
